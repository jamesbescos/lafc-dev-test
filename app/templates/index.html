        <p class="desc imp-desc">Please judge part 2 of this project.</p>
        <p class="desc">I attempted both parts of the project, and that had a large influence on the infrastructure I used for this project. Ultimately I feel stronger in my skills for part 2 and I hope I was able to display creativity in the queries along with the surrounding choices I made for how to present them.</p>
        <p class="desc">Thank you for taking time to view my work. Please let me know if you have any feedback or notice any issues.</p>

        <span>Notes:</span>
        <ul>
            <li>I combined the two merchandise CSVs into a single table ('merchandise') for simplicity.</li>
            <li>In the query for question 3, I use the event date for a ticket to estimate the purchase date. I could not find a field that indicated when tickets were actually purchased.</li>
            <li>In the query for question 3, I did not use the 'first_order_date' field of merchandise and instead just used the order date of the merchandise included in the CSVs. I thought that was more in the spirit of the prompt.</li>
            <li>In the query for question 4, I used 'season_name' and 'minor_category' to identify mls regular season games for 2022, but I am not confident it is an accurate way to do so.</li>
        </ul>
