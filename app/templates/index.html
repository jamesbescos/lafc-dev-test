    <h1>LAFC Business and Data Strategy Project</h1>
    <hr>
        <p class="desc imp-desc">Please judge part 2 of this project.</p>
        <p class="desc">I designed the infrustucture to support both parts of the project. I developed this site as the entrypoint to both parts, and as a platform to embed my tableau report into. I focused on making part 2 as robust as possible and creative in the way it was presented. Because of this, I developed containers for PostgreSQL and a Jupyter Notebook for interactive query exploration.</p>
        <p class="desc">Thank you for taking time to view my work. Please let me know if you have any feedback or notice any issues.</p>

            <li>Dimensions: sale processed relative to event time, quantities per order, item type</li>

        <span>Notes:</span>
        <ul>
            <li>I combined the two merchandise CSVs into a single table ('merchandise') for simplicity.</li>
            <li>In the query for question 3, I used the event date for a ticket to estimate the purchase date.</li>
            <li>In the query for question 3, I did not use the 'first_order_date' field of merchandise and instead just used the order date of the merchandise included in the CSVs. I thought that was more aligned withthe prompt.</li>
            <li>In the query for question 4, I used 'season_name' and 'minor_category' to identify MLS regular season games for 2022.</li>
        </ul>
